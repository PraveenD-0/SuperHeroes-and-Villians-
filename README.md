# Superhero API

The Superhero API is a quantified and programmatically accessible data source of all superheroes from both the comic universe. We've aggregated all the information and organized it in a format that is easier to consume with software. Then we created an API so you can access it hassle-free.

## How to Use

The data is accessible through a REST API. Refer to our documentation to get started. Helper libraries are also provided to help you consume the API in the language of your choice.

## Access the Data

You can access all SuperHeroes and Villains data from all universes under a single API. 

## Technologies Used

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can access the Superhero API and integrate it into your web projects using these technologies.
